# LeetCode Trees in Rust

This library is made to make any LeetCoders using Rust have a better experience
at solving their LeetCode (LC) problems. It uses cargo make to have
reproducible sub modules (check `leetcode-trees-rs/solutions/README.md`) as
well as implementing the definition of the binary trees on LC.
